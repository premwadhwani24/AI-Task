#AI Task Description

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly AI and computer vision projects implemented using Python, OpenCV, and other relevant libraries. Each project is a hands-on example of how artificial intelligence can be applied to solve real-world or classical computer science problems.

1. Gender Detection
This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect the gender of a person from an image or webcam feed. It utilizes OpenCV for face detection and a CNN-based model for gender classification (Male/Female). Useful in security systems, demographic analytics, and more.

2. Monkey Banana Problem (AI Logic-Based Problem)
A classic AI problem in logic programming, the Monkey and Banana Problem involves a monkey trying to get bananas hanging from the ceiling using available tools (like a box). Implemented using AI search algorithms (DFS, BFS, or A*), this problem demonstrates goal-based agent behavior.

3. Color Detection
A computer vision project where users can detect colors in an image by hovering the mouse pointer over them. It displays the color name and RGB values. This is a useful tool for digital design and accessibility purposes.

4. Color Detection Using Webcam
This real-time extension of the color detection project uses the computer's webcam to continuously detect and display the name and RGB values of the color in the central region of the video frame. Implemented using OpenCV and a color dataset.

5. Face Detection
This project detects human faces in images, video, or webcam feeds using Haar cascades or deep learning models like DNN (Deep Neural Networks). It's the foundation of many biometric and surveillance applications.

6. Language Conversion
A simple application that converts text from one language to another using translation APIs like Google Translate. It supports multiple languages and demonstrates the power of natural language processing (NLP) in real-time applications.

7. Voice-Based Calculator
An interactive calculator that takes voice input using a microphone, processes it with speech recognition, performs the required arithmetic operation, and returns the result via text and/or speech. Ideal for accessibility and smart assistants.

8. Water Jug Problem (AI Search)
The classic Water Jug Problem demonstrates AI search techniques like BFS or DFS to find a solution for measuring a specific amount of water using two jugs of known capacity. This project emphasizes state-space exploration and goal achievement.

9. GUI of Water Jug Problem
A graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter that allows users to visually simulate the Water Jug Problem. Users can input jug sizes and target volume and watch the solution steps displayed dynamically. It makes understanding the logic easier for learners.
